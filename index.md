## ðŸŽ‚ Happy Birthday Thomas ðŸŽ‰

### Chapter One - Beginnings

Thomas you've been with us now for a year

And my how you've grown, from a dot to a bear

When we first brought you home, in a storm, to your house

For a whole two weeks you were quiet as a mouse

But it wasn't to last, as you soon learnt to cry

Dad cut your finger - could that be why?


I needed some help, my knowledge was hazy

But all of a sudden the whole world went crazy

Covid, they called it, and locked us all down

"It'll soon blow over", we thought with a frown

Meanwhile the weather stayed cold, dry and bright

And daddy would walk you for miles every night

We frantically searched for our parental powers

And mammy would feed you in all the wee hours

But now the first chapter of this verse is done -

When  counting in months, our baby is **ONE**!

### Chapter Two - Early Days

So onwards and upwards, at least that's what we needed

But sadly the virus's warnings weren't heeded

So blindly we forged in the parenting world

As problems, and issues, and worries unfurled

Things were so bad we all wanted to cry

But only on days that end in a 'y'

But don't let me tell you that nothing was good

We were getting to know our own flesh and blood

I can't say I was stunned when you grew like a week

When you woke every 45 minutes to feed

By now poor old daddy was back into work

I'm sorry to say that this led me to shirk

So patiently mammy stayed up every night

It was no good for her but for Tom it was right


But as he grew into his daddy's good looks

Along came a new foe - the dreaded *REFLUX*

A syringe full of medicine every day

For a poor tiny baby that isn't ok

But nothing could stop you and stronger you got

As Spring became Summer, we loved you - a *lot*

Then daddy worked out what would put you to sleep

Nothing as easy as counting some sheep

Out in the pram every hour of the night

From sunsent, to darkness, to sunrise, to light

Some of the hardest times daddy has known

He'll miss them like hell when you're all big and grown

And so the next part of our story is done

Don't worry - it really does start to get fun

### Chapter Three - Growing

But always the darkest times precede the dawn

You picked a most difficult time to be born

Lockdown (plus baby), part two and part three

Was taking its toll on your mammy and me

And oh how we loved you - believe me, it's true

But can't you just sleep for an hour? Maybe two?

But something was happening in that little brain

It wasn't just Groundhog Day over again

You'd started to roll and to giggle and smile

It made all the difficult times worth their while


We'd always loved musical mornings the most

With weaning these became enhanced with toast

And mammy would make you some lush homemade food

"Sorry!" you'd cry, "I'm just not in the mood!"

But still we had fun with you learning to eat

Little Carb Holvast loves pasta and wheat!

Bathtimes were great, they made our hearts glad

Getting you ready to surf with your dad

And swimming with mammy (when it was allowed)

You both truly loved it and she was so proud

But as the fun summer times came to an end

Once more you tried to drive us round the bend...

### Chapter Three - Autumn

A first family holiday, that sounds all right!

You were so excited you slept through the night

We drove down to Cropton, you slept all the way

We went for a stroll, had a wonderful day

But then came the night time and it was so hot

And you had the most awful and bare travel cot

"That's it!" you declared, "I've had quite enough"

"No more will I sleep, things are going to get rough"

And boy you weren't kidding, you stayed up all week

I couldn't imagine a time be more bleak

But still we pushed on through your principled stand

And went for a rainy day at Flamingo Land

And wouldn't you know, you slept for the whole time

No matter, the torrential rain was maritime



So back we went home but the sleep strike went on

The nights had drawn in and by god they were long

But it wasn't your fault, you had energy to burn

And your brain was exploding with new things to learn

We looked on one day, faces proud and amazed

As you went from a reclined position to raised

"Our boy can sit!" we shouted with glee

Then you turned on your heels and started to flee

"He's crawling, he's crawling!" we couldn't believe

"He's going to be walking by Christmas Eve!"

One day we walked in to your nursery to find

You stood with a mischievous glint in your eye

All of these changes in such a short time

You grew up so fast it was almost a crime

And no you weren't sleeping but you were adored

Even if you became easily bored

Winter was coming and now we deduced

To nursery it was time you were introduced
