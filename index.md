# ðŸŽ‚ Happy Birthday Thomas ðŸŽ‰

# One

  <summary>In which we document the beginning of a magical journey</summary>

### Chapter One - Beginnings

Thomas you've been with us now for a year

And my how you've grown, from a dot to a bear

When we first brought you home, in a storm, to your house

For a whole two weeks you were quiet as a mouse

But it wasn't to last, as you soon learnt to cry

Dad cut your finger - could that be why?


I needed some help, my knowledge was hazy

But all of a sudden the whole world went crazy

Covid, they called it, and locked us all down

"It'll soon blow over", we thought with a frown

Meanwhile the weather stayed cold, dry and bright

And daddy would walk you for miles every night

We frantically searched for our parental powers

And mammy would feed you in all the wee hours

But now the first chapter of this verse is done -

When  counting in months, our baby is **ONE**!

---

### Chapter Two - Early Days

So onwards and upwards, at least that's what we needed

But sadly the virus's warnings weren't heeded

So blindly we forged in the parenting world

As problems, and issues, and worries unfurled

Things were so bad we all wanted to cry

But only on days that end in a 'y'

But don't let me tell you that nothing was good

We were getting to know our own flesh and blood

I can't say I was stunned when you grew like a weed

When you woke every 45 minutes to feed

By now poor old daddy was back into work

I'm sorry to say that this led me to shirk

So patiently mammy stayed up every night

It was no good for her but for Tom it was right


But as he grew into his daddy's good looks

Along came a new foe - the dreaded *REFLUX*

A syringe full of medicine every day

For a poor tiny baby that isn't ok

But nothing could stop you and stronger you got

As Spring became Summer, we loved you - a *lot*

Then daddy worked out what would put you to sleep

Nothing as easy as counting some sheep

Out in the pram every hour of the night

From sunset, to darkness, to sunrise, to light

Some of the hardest times daddy has known

He'll miss them like hell when you're all big and grown

And so the next part of our story is done

Don't worry - it really does start to get fun

---

### Chapter Three - Growing

But always the darkest times precede the dawn

You picked a most difficult time to be born

Lockdown (plus baby), part two and part three

Was taking its toll on your mammy and me

And oh how we loved you - believe me, it's true

But can't you just sleep for an hour? Maybe two?

But something was happening in that little brain

It wasn't just Groundhog Day over again

You'd started to roll and to giggle and smile

It made all the difficult times worth their while


We'd always loved musical mornings the most

With weaning these became enhanced with toast

And mammy would make you some lush homemade food

"Sorry!" you'd cry, "I'm just not in the mood!"

But still we had fun with you learning to eat

Little Carb Holvast loves pasta and wheat!

Bathtimes were great, they made our hearts glad

Getting you ready to surf with your dad

And swimming with mammy (when it was allowed)

You both truly loved it and she was so proud

But as the fun summer times came to an end

Once more you tried to drive us round the bend...

---

### Chapter Three - Autumn

A first family holiday, that sounds all right!

You were so excited you slept through the night

We drove down to Cropton, you slept all the way

We went for a stroll, had a wonderful day

But then came the night time and it was so hot

And you had the most awful and bare travel cot

"That's it!" you declared, "I've had quite enough"

"No more will I sleep, things are going to get rough"

And boy you weren't kidding, you stayed up all week

I couldn't imagine a time be more bleak

But still we pushed on through your principled stand

And went for a rainy day at Flamingo Land

And wouldn't you know, you slept the whole time

No matter, the torrential rain was maritime



So back we went home but the sleep strike went on

The nights had drawn in and by god they were long

But it wasn't your fault, you had energy to burn

And your brain was exploding with new things to learn

We looked on one day, faces proud and amazed

As you went from a reclined position to raised

"Our boy can sit!" we shouted with glee

Then you turned on your heels and started to flee

"He's crawling, he's crawling!" we couldn't believe

"He's going to be walking by Christmas Eve!"

One day we walked in to your nursery to find

You stood with a mischievous glint in your eye

All of these changes in such a short time

You grew up so fast it was almost a crime

And no you weren't sleeping but you were adored

Even if you became easily bored

Winter was coming and now we deduced

To nursery it was time you were introduced

---

### Chapter 4 - Family Christmas

The cold winds had started to blow from the North

But still we would do coastal walks back and forth

The days getting shorter but full of good cheer

Mammy and daddy love this time of year

But as you were still a most difficult child

Boisterous and shouty and really quite wild

We took a decision that broke daddy's heart

You were going to nursery for an early start

To soften the blow for our poor little man

On a Monday you'd go to your opa and gran

But slowly we found that we'd made the right call

And Thomas at nursery was having a ball

We'd heard of strange nursery powers at play

They seem to cause babies to sleep - in the day

And so it turned out, your naps then improved

Sadly at night you were largely unmoved


And would you believe it, another new issue

You sneezed and were wheezy and needed a tissue

It seemed every week you'd picked up a new bug

"It's good for your system", we said with a shrug

But Santa was coming and you really weren't well

The night before Christmas was something like hell

You stayed in our bed and cried all the night

You must have given Santa an almighty fright

But 4AM came and you woke with a start

Santa had been and he took you to heart

Everything that a boy needs to go far

A ballpit, a car and a pair of guitars

We took you to grandma's to open a box

And inside you found a new horse that rocks

Despite the lockdown Christmas, we had a lot of fun

Days like this are truly why we wanted our own son

Then we went to see your auntie, uncle, cousins too

But you slept most all the time, Christmas is tiring, phew!

You slept that night, eventually, thinking 'Christmas is ace'

And the next day had a visit to grandpa Richard and grandma Grace

You had now had your first Christmas season

But more lockdowns beckoned, festive visits were the reason

As we moved into a new isolation

Opa decided you were a crustacean

You scuttled around and with nails you did stab

Opa called you detective inspector crab

But despite all the hardships things could have been worse

And now we come on to our final verse

---

### Chapter 5 - Walking, Talking Boy

"Dada! Mama! Cat! Vroom vroom!"

You burbled while pushing your cars round the room

And not content with learning to talk

You got to your feet and started to walk

You'd go for a sprint and to daddy you'd dive

Or stand on the spot and boogie and jive

Nursery was honing your social skills no end

They told us you even had a girlfriend!

You're lovely and funny and handsome and smart

You really could melt any old grinch's heart

You just want to be with your mammy and me

Especially in the morning when the clock strikes three

And now we can start to look forward a bit

As the world slowly tries to get itself fit

We'll all learn together the things that you like

Like puppies and football and riding a bike

Early starts are still the norm

But now the weather is getting warm

There's hope and positivity in the air

You might have to look but I promise it's there

You bring out the best in your mam and dad

And even though you drive us mad

Having you is the best thing I've ever done

You'll never know how proud I am to call you... son.

Love dad.

# Two

  <summary>In which we marvel at the emergence of a tiny genius</summary>

### Chapter One - More Of The Same

And just like that our baby was one
  
It felt like he had just begun

If I said it got easier I would have lied

So strap yourself in for the next part of our ride

Because as it happens, nothing had changed

And mammy and daddy were feeling deranged

There was no denying this year took its toll

We needed to get ourselves back on a roll

What could we do for our wee little boy

To settle him down and bring him some joy

"Bairns all love doggies!" said daddy with glee

And before long we had brought home... Ripley!

And while mammy loved him and daddy went walking

Thomas was far more concerned with his talking

He put his own stepping on hold for a bit

And focussed on honing his rapier wit

Because despite all of the pain we'd been through

You'd realised your laughter stopped us feeling blue

Then all of a sudden the talking had ceased

You decided you'd rather focus on your feet

You climbed and you clambered, you stumbled and fell

But that didn't stop you and soon you walked well

Your confidence led to an obvious call

It was high time that daddy bought you a football

And games in the garden were all sorts of fun

Ripley and Thomas would make daddy run

But obviously there was one thing we'd forgot

Doggies and kitties will fight - quite a lot

### Chapter Two - Hell Breaks Loose

As Spring turned to Summer times were extra hard

Roxy could no longer go in the yard

Ripley would chase and bark all of the while

And mammy and daddy could not reconcile

The time that we spent on schooling the dog

Whilst having to neglect our precious young sprog

But what could we do except soldier on?

And hope one day we could sleep just past the dawn

But as we accepted that you'd never sleep

We made a decision that didn't come cheap

We found a new home for our lush Ripley dog

But we remain in constant dialogue

Maybe one year we'll be ready again

But we certainly won't quickly forget this pain

But slowly we emerged as a unit once more

And you could see fully how you were adored

Maybe we spoilt you but what can I say

You brought the sunshine into every day

If only, if only, you fancied a kip

Daddy would dance and mammy would skip

But this was still seemingly one step too far

We saw the sun even less than the stars

### Chapter Three - Sleep At Last

So by now you know that the struggle was real

That five letter word - TIRED was all we could feel

So Helen and Kev offered a tip

"Chuck him in bed and get out of there quick!"

So we did, and he screamed and he thrashed like we thought

Never before had he been so distraught

But plough on we did as we hadn't a choice

If nothing else you might have just lost your voice

But as we rolled on to the third or fourth night

You gave a small murmur then fell asleep tight

And something else happened, we thought you were broken

Morning was here and we hadn't been woken

What on earth was this feeling we had in our head

Not constantly pining and yearning for bed

And our cheeky young boy, this irascible chap

Was sleeping all night plus a two hour nap

We took him on holiday with grandma and opa

Did the disruption cause sleep loss? Not a single iota!

And all of a sudden everything was good

We no longer felt we were running through mud

But as we now know we just can't have nice things

I think you can guess what the next chapter brings

### Chapter Four - Ha Ha Just Kidding!

Mammy and daddy shared an anxious glance

Could he be teething? Poorly, perchance?

Surely there must be a reasonable answer

To why Thomas is impersonating a dancer

And screaming like Meatloaf in the dead of night

This isn't like him, he'll sleep again... right?!

Dear reader, by now you know how this all ends

With mammy and daddy driven round the bend

But so it transpired, for many more weeks

Months in fact with a stunning lack of sleep

No longer just waking in need of a hug

Now it was hours but you were too tired to lug

Around in our arms, so downstairs we went

Until, after two hours or so, you were spent

And you'd finally sleep again at five AM

Daddy was lucky to get five minutes' REM

And as for deep sleep? You're having a laugh!

Seeing you sleep was worth a photograph

So how did we get through this difficult time?

That went to ridiculous from the sublime

It's easy, at least to explain looking back

Daddy was already an insomniac

And also we loved you and seeing you grow

Was worth anything that we had to forego

### Chapter Five - Character

We took you on holiday to stay on a boat

Although this one was no longer afloat

Atop a big hill surrounded by sheep

We took you to Beadnell to play on the beach

And even despite the torrential rain

(And the tent-destroying hurricane)

You wanted to play outside with the ball

And invited the baa baas and animals all

Because this was what kind of boy you'd become

Greater than all of the parts of your sum

You may not have slept but of all of your quirks

That was the only one still needing work

For never a happier boy did I see

Or a kinder one whose daddy I'd rather be

And everyone said so, it wasn't just me

You were the favourite at your nursery

We knew by now that you loved to make us grin

By smiling and joking and putting cars in the bin

But it seemed that you'd got mammy's brains as well

And as Christmas rolled round we said farewell

To our little baby who'd grown into a boy

And brought us a limitless supply of joy

And yes there were tough times along the way

But watching him learn how to walk, talk and play

Meant he was on Santa's nice list

And this year Warvastelly Christmas wouldn't be missed

Christmas Morning with Mammy and Daddy (and toys)

Then over to grandma and opa's for noise

With Molly and Ham and Van and Bob

Henen and Kev, indeed the whole mob

A sign of things still yet to come

As we rise out of the glum

Of another year of the pandemic

But the past is all academic

Because as the New Year rolled around

We still had a familiar sound

Up and crying every night

But maybe 2022 will be the year we get it right

### Chapter Six - Big Lad

And as your birthday rolled around

At nursery you were quite renowned

For your winning smile and golden curls

And your successes with the girls

And all we heard at bedtime each night

Was how you and Isaac were so tight

The best of friends, though you had many

Max, Rowan, Maria, Toby - have I missed any??

So mammy and daddy have our routine

Involving four hours of sleep between

Watching our little boy grow healthy and strong

In the household we built just for you to belong

And it could be a million times more tough

Just one laugh from you and it would still be enough

So thank you for coming and being our son

Mammy and daddy love you

A ton

# Three

  <summary>In which Thomas bypasses toddlerhood and becomes a boy</summary>

### Chapter One - A New Dawn

As you embarked on your third year with us

Strange things were happening, we had to discuss

How the world once more was opening up

With new opportunities for our young pup

For no longer were faces all covered by masks

And we no longer worried about routine tasks

Like going to shops or the park or our friends'

Wherever we took you our pride knew no ends

For challenging though our home life had been

When out and about you were a sight to be seen

And as the pubs and the restaurants opened once more

Some of our sanity began to restore

And you discovered a love of scampi

Divers gold from the beautiful briny North Sea

And we made some more time to see people you love

You and Elodie just seemed to fit like a glove

And Matthew and Stacey were two of your faves

But never forgetting your best uncle Dave

And every compliment people did pay

Made us feel happy and proud in every way

### Chapter 2 - Big Boy Bed

A magical point in every child's life

A first step to having control of their life

"It couldn't get worse", mammy and daddy said

"Why not? We'll give him his first big boy bed"

So off came the bars and down went the base

And oh, the excitement on Thomas's face

"My very own bed!" and in it he jumped

But several hours later there came a great THUMP

And lo, as we raced to his room through the door

There was our boy, asleep on the floor

### Chapter 3 - Tour De Tynemouth

Finally daddy decided 'twas time

To get on the bike when the weather was fine

A bike seat arrived and Thomas got on

And whoosh! just like that we were gone!

"SLOW DOWN! NOT TOO FAST!" he cried as I rode

At 3 miles per hour, down Shipley Road

But slowly (so slowly) he learned to enjoy

The love of a bike that lives in every boy

And we'd cycle with mammy to the pirate pool

Arriving in style, a picture of cool

And did I mentioned our boy could now swim?

(Although he still didn't like to jump in)

So all of the things that little boys do

Our little man was ticking off too

Although football lessons fell by the wayside

As all Thomas wanted was to run round the sides

The same went for Tumble, we started to see

Classes and structure? No, not for he

But nevertheless, his interests ballooned

As did the toy stash in the front room

### Chapter 4 - Family Man

As Thomas began to decide who he loved

One category was always above

That was his family, Molly and Sam

Grandma and Opa, Uncle Rob and Auntie Val

Helen and Kev are never forgotten

It got to the stage when bedtimes were rotten

That mammy said what about a family song?

And before we knew it he was singing along

To all of his family at bed every night

He thinks of you all to help him sleep tight

### Chapter 5 - Boys Of Summer

And summer rolled round, those halcyon days

Where every little boy in the land plays

With his mates in the garden and down at the sea

And Rowan and Max came along abd agreed

That nothing was better than getting all wet

We bought for the garden his favourite toy yet

A paddling pool for the days when the sun

Was scorching above and there was naught to be done

And soon we discovered his genius was true

As he sat on the potty and did a big POO

Mammy and daddy were ever so thrilled

Though less so whenver the contents were spilled

And yet it confirmed what we tried not to suspect

Our boy was growing, we'd have to accept

That no longer a little baby was he

He even did big boy wees against the trees!

### Chapter 6 - Music Man

And growing up with a rock star for a daddy

And a classically trained blues singing mammy

There was really no choice that music would find him

What would he choose? Gospel, blues, hymns?

As it happens his taste came mainly from his mam

Rocking out to the Cadillac Three in his pram

"This song is the favourite of Lightning McQueen!"

He'd declare as he belted to people unseen

In the shops and the streets of our quaint little city

Imploring them please, "DON'T FORGET THE WHISKEY!"

He sang about Florida, that he was thirsty

And how he wanted to get down and dirty

And if we passed a cute little miss

He'd instruct to her to "LEAN IN AND GIMME A KISS"

And were we embarrassed? Perish the thought

A musical child is the best gift we could be brought

### Chapter 7 - Paw Patrol Intervention

And Christmas came round, as it's wont to do

We thought we'd escaped the terrible twos

Until one fateful day with a poorly boy

He watched TV all day and played with no toys

His eyes became squares like in a cartoon

He watched under the sun he watched under the moon

We tried to ask him to please turn it off

He'd scream and cry, turn red and cough

One day we said simply "enough is enough"

"TWO EPISODES and then the TV is OFF"

And would you believe it? It worked for a while

Though he might ask for more with a cute little smile

This parenting lark is not quite so bad

We thought until our little boy turned... sad :(

### Chapter 8 - Sad Boy

We'd already seen enough colic to last

Several lifetimes but damn, drat and blast

It seemed once again we could do nothing right

You cried through the day and you screamed through the night

And when, once a smile half appeared on your face

We asked "are you happy?" and gave you an embrace

Alas, our little toonager said

"I'm not happy, I'm said boy" instead

We threw up our hands and exclaimed in despair

"What are we doing so wrong little bear?!"

But now and again we would notice with glee

Your happiness shining through your stormy seas

And so once again we returned to that phrase

That serves us so well - "It's only a phase"

### Chapter 9 - Two Going On 43

Then all of a sudden the questions you asked

Made us do double takes, step back and gasp

For what kind of two year old knows how to say

"Ooh, that wind's picking up out there today"

And "Grayson, are you ok to talk?"

"Daddy, let's take my toys for a walk"

And "Roxy dog, how many times must I tell you?"

"Hi baby Seb, where did they buy you?"

How could we wonder why you can't sleep

When the thoughts going round in your head were so deep

### Chapter 10 - The Wizard Of Merlin

Finally mammy and daddy worked out

The cause of your anger and sadness and doubt

BFF Isaac had moved up a room

At nursery and this left you wallowing in gloom

But you didn't want to leave Camelot

And go into Merlin away from the tots

You were so nervous it gave you nightmares

"THERE'S POO ON MY PILLOW, THERE'S POO EVERYWHERE!"

"THERE'S POO ON MY HANDS AND MY BED AND MY FACE"

You screamed with alarm as dad tried to trace

The source of the poo that no one else could see

Hallucinations and fever, it just had to be

Enough was enough, dad had decided

And so into Merlin we marched undivided

And all of a sudden, Isaac appeared

And Merlin was no longer a place to be feared

With nary a glance back at his proud dad

Thomas ran off, no longer sad

And so brings an end to this difficult year

But one which has seen a new Thomas appear

No longer a baby, a toddler, no

Our boy is so big, where does the time go?

And all of the challenging times that we face

Are worth it times ten, 'cause Thomas...

Yer ace.
